# Grid-Solver

Grid Solver is an program that uses the maze algorithm to find the least distance from the source to a destination(or destinations). For the purpose of matching wires in computer chips without them overlapping or causing a high usage of wires. This only for a 2D grid, unable to solve with a 3D grid. Grid can be changed at the top of the file.

Takes in a single input file where it reads the source and destination coordinates. Must be in that format, refer to input file for format details.

Outputs a single output file where it shows what path it needs to take from the source to a destination (Can change depending on what order the destinations are in). (W,E,N,S) refers respectfully to west east north and south.
